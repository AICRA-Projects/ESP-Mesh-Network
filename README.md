## What is a mesh network?
A mesh network is a network in which devices -- or nodes -- are linked together, branching off other devices or nodes. These networks are set up to efficiently route data between devices and clients. They help organizations provide a consistent connection throughout a physical space.
Nodes in a network are programmed with software that tells the node how to handle information and interact with the network.
Mesh networks use routing or flooding techniques to send messages. In routing, a message hops from node to node to get to its destination. The mesh network must have continuous connections and reconfigure itself if a path is broken, using self-healing algorithms. There will often be more than one path between a source and a destination.
Mesh networks enable many devices to share internet connectivity, and for devices to communicate directly without first going through the internet. The utility of a mesh network over other network types, such as a hub and spoke network, is that if a node is too far away from the hub, it can still communicate via a closer node until it reaches a router.
